Developer Requirements
======================

This guide will enumerate the dependencies that you need in order to start development on the Cosmo Taste Game.
Most of the dependencies revolve around installing python and installing a vagrant, a virtual machine software.
While you *should* be able to utilize your local environment, tasks such as building documentation and the windows
installable require special configuration. It is generally easier to utilize vagrant to ensure a consistent build
environment.
